### OUR COURSE

Skip to: R download and install, Lessons, Capstone, and Readings 

This course is intended to introduce you to some data science skills using the open source (and freely available) R software. This course consists of several videos, written tutorials and coding walk-thoughs. There are deeper dives into thinking about data and the craft of data science. These are held in person but the materials will be made available here. 

The course is centered around data in our own backyard here in New Mexico. If you follow along for the whole course you will have a completed draft R script (you can think of this as a paper). The idea is not to have a finished project for publication but rather to become a better data science practioner. Ideally what you learn and practice here will carry over in whatever path your are taking. 

If you want to learn about data science or are curious about what kinds of data are being generated in New Mexico, this course is for you. If you are a researcher or someone who needs to write reports with large or small data this should be of particular interest for you. 

We'll aim to keep each "lesson" at about an hour. The in person workshops are likely to run around 3 hours. There will also be asynchronous workshops held virtually.
