### R DOWNLOAD

Often the more difficult problem is getting R downloaded and installed. As of 2025-06-10 you can follow this link 
https://www.r-project.org/ which should drop into a page that looks like this:

Click on the download R.

You should see this page

I generally scroll down to the United States links and click on one of those. 

From here you will click on the link to your computers operating system. This will take you so a screen like this:

If you are on a machine provided by your workplace or doing this from a work location you may need to chat with 
your IT folks about getting access and installing software. 

### Linux
If you have some version of Linux, click on that link and you will see something like this:

If your particular version is not there open up a search engine of your choice and type 
```
install R software -name of your type of linux- 
```
In case you haven't seen this before replace -name of your type of linux- with your Linux version, in my case
it's a version of Ubuntu. You can also install by way of the command line (likely called Terminal). 

### MacOS
For the MacOS download you will need to know what kind of processor you have. You can google this information or go
over to your Apple Menu and click on About this Mac.

These should download automatically but check download status in your browser to make sure. Once download you will
likely double click on the R download and your computer will take you through installing it. Always double check to make
sure it actually installed. 

You've made it this far. We are on to installing the graphical interface (GUI) for using R since it's a little easier
and what I use day to day.
