### R DOWNLOAD

Often the more difficult problem is getting R downloaded and installed. As of 2025-06-10 you can follow this link 
https://www.r-project.org/ which should drop into a page that looks like this:

Click on the download R.

You should see this page

I generally scroll down to the United States links and click on one of those. 

From here you will click on the link to your computers operating system. This will take you so a screen like this:

If you are on a machine provided by your workplace or doing this from a work location you may need to chat with 
your IT folks about getting access and installing software. 

If you have some version of Linux, click on that link and you will see something like this:

If your particular version is not there open up a search engine of your choice and type 
```
install R software -name of your type of linux- 
```
In case you haven't seen this before replace -name of your type of linux- with your Linux version, in my case
it's a version of Ubuntu.
